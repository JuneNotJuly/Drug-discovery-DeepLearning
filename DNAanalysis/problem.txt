Specification
Define an object type that a programmer can store and analyse DNA sequences. The object type
should have basic database functions, such as the loading and saving of sequences, analysis of
sequences, and searching within sequences. You must use object-oriented programming. Define
at least one class type for the database, but 2 or more classes may allow for easier
implementation. Name your DNA sequence database object type DNA_DB. For example, to create
a database object, you would write DNA_DB dna_db; in your main() function.

Implement an opening menu:
DNA Sequence Database Software
Specify the name of DNA sequence file names you would like to load. For
multiple files, add a ‘,’ between each file name.
>

The > specifies to the user that an input is required. The user will specify the name of DNA
sequences written in the FASTA format (.fa files). If all files are valid, then load the DNA
sequences into your DNA sequence database object, otherwise, ask the user to specify the names
again. Multiple file names can be entered by separating the names using a comma (,).

Once the DNA sequences are loaded, display the following menu:
Select one of the following options
(S) Summary statistics of the DNA database
(1) Analyse DNA_sequence_1
(2) Analyse DNA_sequence_2
(3) Analyse DNA_sequence_3
(4) Analyse DNA_sequence_4
(Q) Quit
>

Option S should display the number of sequences loaded into the database. For each sequence,
display the sequence name and identifiers and the number of base pairs.
Option Q should quit the program.
Numeric options, (e.g., 1-4 in this example), should list the name of each DNA sequence loaded
into the database (e.g., file name). Selection of a number should bring up the subsequent menu.

Once a numeric option is selected, display the following menu:
Select one of the following options
(H) Help
(S) Summary statistics of the DNA sequence
(1) Analyse gap region
(2) Analyse coded region
(3) Analyse base pair range
(4) Find DNA sequence by manual input
(5) Find DNA sequence by file input
(R) Return to the previous menu
(Q) Quit
>

Option H should specify information that is useful for understanding how to read DNA sequences,
such as the meaning of each character representation of the nucleotides (see Reference).
Option S should display the name and identifiers for the sequence selected. It should also display
the number of base pairs, the number of gap regions (specified by N’s), the number of coded
regions (specified by non-N characters, such as A,G,T,C, etc.), the number of gap region
nucleotides, the number of coded region nucleotides, the number of A, G, T, C, etc. specified (see
Reference for full list of nucleotide characters).
Option 1 should result in the user being asked for a number, n, which should represent the nth gap
region. Display the base pair number range, gap or coded region number, and the region’s
nucleotide symbols.
Option 2 should result in the user being asked for a number, n, which should represent the nth
coded region. Display the base pair number range, gap or coded region number, and the specified
region’s nucleotide symbols.
Option 3 should result in the user being asked for two numbers, n and m. Display the base pair
number range and the nucleotide symbols specified by this range.
Option 4 should result in the user being asked for at least 10 nucleotide symbols. Display the base
pair number range where these 10 nucleotides symbols occur in sequence. Display 20 symbols
before, the nucleotide symbols specified, and 20 symbols after.
Option 5 should result in the user being asked for a file name that specifies at least 10 nucleotide
symbols. The file should be in the FASTA format (.fa file name). Display the base pair number
range where these 10 nucleotides symbols occur in sequence. Display 20 symbols before, the
nucleotide symbols specified, and 20 symbols after.
Option R should return the user to the previous menu.
Option Q should quit the program.
For all menu options, the user should be asked to re-enter a value until a valid input is specified
